# ol-9-workstation-essentials
My personal list of repos, packages, and other knick-knacks for setting up Oracle Linux 9 on a Workstation or Laptop.

NOTE FOR ORACLE EMPLOYEES: This can be used in addition to OL-9 on a verified compliant compute device. It does not replace or conflict with that configuration.
